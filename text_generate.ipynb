', 'his worldly commitments are now three or four ', 'deep. between us, he was no doubt bent on the son- ', \"net in the first place from habit, and what's the use \", 'in pretending he was a freer agent than he had any ', 'ambition to be? he had made most of his commit- ', 'ments all in one plunge. the only suspense he asks ', 'us to share with him is in the theme. he goes down, ', 'for instance, to a depth that must surprise him as ', \"much as it does us. but he doesn't even have the say \", 'of how long his piece will be. any worry is as to ', 'whether he will outlast or last out the fourteen ', 'lines have to cramp or stretch to come out even ', 'have enough bread for the butter or butter for the ', 'bread. as a matter of fact, he gets through in twelve ', \"lines and doesn't know quite what to do with the \", 'last two.
